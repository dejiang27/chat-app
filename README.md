# chat-app

The user is able to login with the username chandlergegg@gmail.com and password csc436!. 

The user is not able to get the chat application if logins is unsuccessful. 

I tried to add functions for the minim_chat_window button or the close_windows_button, but for some reasons it is not working. Therefore, I just added the minim_chat_window button or the close_windows_button.

Extra credit:

When the user clicks the logout button, the user will be signed out of the chat application.
